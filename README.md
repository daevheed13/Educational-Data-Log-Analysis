# Educational-Data-Log-Analysis

This repo cantains analysis of the 2019 10 Academy learners activity in the Moodle Learning Management System. The moodle LMS is a highly scalable framework, and all students activities are stored in a highly structured database. 

10 Academy, like any other educational facility, is interested to understand the learners skill and knowledge development, and is interested to build models that are able to predict possible dropouts as well as classify learners into doing, well, doing ok, and struggling groups. 10 Academy is also interested in automating the process of reminding learners approaching deadlines, providing quick feedback based on their overall community engagement and performance. Moreover, given the main goal of 10 Academy training is to make students job ready, it wants to measure students' performance across many relevant metrics. 

The tasks are divided into four sub-tasks:
 - Moodle database schema understanding
 - Data Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL)
 - Dashboard making with Tableau
 - Automation and Deployment
